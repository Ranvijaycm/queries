The problem is when i first enter 7 . the program terminates and is successful.<br>
When i first enter any number other than 7, the program continues and then in second attempt i enter 7, it terminates and is successful.<br><br>
but in the third case...
first attept : any other number than 7
second attempt : any other number than 7
third attempt : 7 <br>
(here the program does not terminate and goes in infinite loop)
